I- Introduction
The website will be a central database for all Wellesley students to find friends, mentors, and mentees based on specific criteria. Currently, Wellesley students rely mostly on their departments, organizations, residential halls, and class Facebook groups to meet friends and mentors who have a similar background to them or who share their interests and passions. However, the process to find the “perfect” big could be lengthy for some first-year students especially if they belong to minority groups. 

Some first-year students transition to their second year without having yet found mentors and friends as a  support group. This could lead to a feeling of loneliness and an urge to leave Wellesley as they think it wasn’t a good fit for them. It may also lead to missing opportunities due to the absence of guidance from upper-class students in their field of interest. 

This website will help first-year students (and other students) find friends quicker as well as connect with upper-class students who share their academic and/or professional interests. 


II- The goals of the website:
To have a central networking space for students searching for mentorship  opportunities 
To enable students to find and connect with friends
To allow upper-class students to connect and mentor first-years and sophomores
To allow students to connect with fellow students based on shared academic and/or professional interests
